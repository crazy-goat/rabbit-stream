## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- `DeclarePublisherRequestV1` — client-side request to register a publisher on a stream (key `0x0001`)
- `DeclarePublisherResponseV1` — server response for DeclarePublisher
- `KeyEnum::DECLARE_PUBLISHER_RESPONSE` (`0x8001`) registered in `KeyEnum` and `ResponseBuilder`
- GitHub Actions CI workflow — unit tests on PHP 8.1–8.4 matrix + E2E tests with RabbitMQ 4
- PHPUnit test suite — unit tests for all Request/Response/Buffer classes
- E2E test suite — integration tests against real RabbitMQ via Docker
- `docker-compose.yml` for local RabbitMQ development
- `run-e2e.sh` script to start Docker, wait for health and run E2E suite
- `tasks/` directory with markdown specs for all 26 unimplemented protocol commands
- `AGENTS.md` development guide with conventions, commands and implementation templates

### Fixed
- `ReadBuffer::getInt16()` and `getInt32()` — were returning unsigned values instead of signed (broke null string/bytes parsing)
- `WriteBuffer::addArray()` — was referencing non-existent `StreamBufferInterface` instead of `ToStreamBufferInterface`
- `WriteBuffer::UINT64_MAX` — exceeded PHP `int` range (was `float`)
- `PeerPropertiesToStreamBufferV1` — fixed `getKeYVersion()` typo → `getKeyVersion()`
- `DeclarePublisherRequestV1` — null `publisherReference` serializes as empty string `""` (server rejects null string `0xFFFF`)

### Changed
- `composer.json` — added `phpunit/phpunit ^10.5` as dev dependency with `autoload-dev` for `tests/`
- `README.md` — added full project description, usage example and protocol implementation status table
